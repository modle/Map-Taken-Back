- Split element radios into groups (all/raw, elements, status effects)
	* Each row is a table; may use this to rearrange later.

Bugs
2015-03-27
- items added to the wish list or armory only show up after the next refresh, not on the refresh they are added
	* Tables load before code checks for additions
	* Fixed. Moved armory/wish list/upgrade table loads after main section load (which contains the insert statements)

2015-03-26
- wish list clearing randomly. idkwtf.
	* Fixed. Had some stray delete sql from an earlier version.

- sliders no longer submit page on change - css problem? The rest of the slider change script is triggering

- rare values in upgrade path div are all set to the selected weapon, rather than indicated weapon
	* Fixed. Query was referencing selected weapon rather than iterated weapon.
