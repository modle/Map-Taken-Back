What's New


2015-04-23

- Session variables, hurray!
- Removed 'links' from weapon names 
  * This allows the width to adjust dynamically, wrapping the text to another row; keeps table within div
  * Replaced functionality with an upgrade icon/button
- Split search and upgrade path functionality
  * Had been populating the text search field with the weapon name, and loading the path
    + This was annoying, since user would have to reset the search field and resubmit the page to get the full weapon table back
- Can no longer populate the search field from the main weapon table
  * This can only be achieved by clicking the search icon in path or wishlist
