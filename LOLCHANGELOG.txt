What's New

2015-03-28
- Added delete icons to armory and wishlist
- Data cleanup - replaced ' in database with &#39;
	* This cleans up a lot of the queries; had been losing data when string contained
		+ Only became an issue when adding armory/wishlist delete functionality, since the search was partial string match

		

2015-03-27
- Added zoom function to map. Click to activate.
	* http://www.jacklmoore.com/zoom - pretty slick

2015-03-26
- Started a CHANGELOG. lolDocumentation. 
	* (I AM keeping an archive of versions, based on date. I'll git with it someday.)
- Combined weapon tables into a single table
	* can now view all weapon data by choosing 'All Weapons' from the drop-down
	* added weapon type icons next to the weapon names
		+ click the weapon icon to set the weapon type drop-down filter to that weapon type

- Changed element icons to image submits. 
	* Clicking an element icon will set the element filter to that element		

- Split element radios into groups (all/raw, elements, status effects)
	* Each row is a table; may use this to rearrange later.

- Set width %s on weapon table columns for consistency when filtering

- Cleaned up weapon data
	* special will be NULL(blank) instead of 0 for weapons without special data
	* shortened the special info for insect glaive (cutting > cut, ' ~ ' > '~')
	
	
- Cursor types on hover
	- Check boxes or weapon names : pointer		
	- Sliders : resize
	- Map : cross-hairs

2015-03-25
- Click name in main weapon table to see upgrade path
- Click name in path to see upgrade path for that name
- Click search icon to stuff weapon search field with that name
	
Bugs

2015-03-27
- items added to the wish list or armory only show up after the next refresh, not on the refresh they are added
	* Tables load before code checks for additions
	* Fixed. Moved armory/wish list/upgrade table loads after main section load (which contains the insert statements)

2015-03-26
- wish list clearing randomly. idkwtf.
	* Fixed. Had some stray delete sql from an earlier version.
- sliders no longer submit page on change - css problem? The rest of the slider change script is triggering
- rare values in upgrade path div are all set to the selected weapon, rather than indicated weapon
	* Fixed. Query was referencing selected weapon rather than iterated weapon.
