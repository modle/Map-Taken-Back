Bugs

2015-04-23
- Monster id not getting posted; dropdown is defaulting every time
  * Fixed. Was referencing modules/weapons/hidden_inputs.php instead of modules/monsters/hidden_inputs.php

- Setting dropdown in armor aside of skills pages causes armor aside to not load; 
  * setPiece is getting stored in session, 
	since clicking on a skill name from the main section again shows the armor aside, 
	with the proper slot selected in the dropdown

- skill and armor names need to be escaped to load side panel data properly. See 'hunter's. ..'


2015-03-29
- certain skills aren't showing up when searching by name
  * Fixed. First row of results was being parsed outside the while/table loop

2015-03-27
- items added to the wish list or armory only show up after the next refresh, not on the refresh they are added
  * Tables load before code checks for additions
  * Fixed. Moved armory/wish list/upgrade table loads after main section load (which contains the insert statements)

2015-03-26
- wish list clearing randomly. idkwtf.
  * Fixed. Had some stray delete sql from an earlier version.

- sliders no longer submit page on change
  * css problem? The rest of the slider change script is triggering

- rare values in upgrade path div are all set to the selected weapon, rather than indicated weapon
  * Fixed. Query was referencing selected weapon rather than iterated weapon.
